<div class="content">
    <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯꜜɕi] or [sɯɕiꜜ]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi),
        usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ neta), such as seafood, vegetables,
        and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient
        is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).
        Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
        short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
        imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi,
        and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
        Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw
        fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.</p>

    <h2>Short history of sushi</h2>
    <p>Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in
        fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from
        spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an
        important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form
        no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or
        savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga
        Prefecture.
        Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
        Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of
        enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar
        significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually
        abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became
        oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden
        (typically bamboo) molds.
        It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. The
        particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One
        common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the
        technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku. The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught
        fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for
        quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.
        The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an 1893 book,
        A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other
        flavoring". There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,
        and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.</p>

    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>The common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared sushi rice. Fillings, toppings, condiments, and
        preparation vary widely.
        Due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is spelled with zu instead of su when a prefix is attached, as in
        nigirizushi.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>All sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Sushi-meshi</h2>
    <p>Sushi-meshi 鮨飯 (also known as Su-meshi 酢飯, shari 舎利, or gohan ご飯) is a preparation of white, short-grained,
        Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and sake. It
        has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a sushi or else it will get too sticky
        while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub
        or barrel, and a wooden paddle (shamoji).
        Sushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain
        strains such as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its
        stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from glutinous rice. Freshly
        harvested rice (shinmai) typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker
        after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.
        There are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the
        variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kantō region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly
        uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.</p>

    <h2>Nori</h2>
    <p>The black seaweed wrappers used in makimono are called nori (海苔). Nori is a type of algae, traditionally
        cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin,
        edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making rice paper. Today, the commercial
        product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.
        The size of a nori sheet influences the size of makimono. A full-size sheet produces futomaki, and a half
        produces hosomaki and temaki. To produce gunkan and some other makimono, an appropriately-sized piece of nori is
        cut from a whole sheet.
        Nori by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored
        variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.
        When making fukusazushi, a paper-thin omelette may replace a sheet of nori as the wrapping. The omelette is
        traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan, known as a makiyakinabe, and used to form the pouch for the
        rice and fillings.</p>

    <h2>Gu</h2>
    <p>The ingredients used inside sushi are called gu, and are, typically, varieties of fish. For culinary,
        sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to
        that of fish which is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell,
        color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly used fish
        are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba),
        and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a
        variety of ōtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and chūtoro, meaning "middle toro", implying that it
        is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the
        fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw toppings,
        called neta.
        Other seafoods such as squid (ika), eel (anago and unagi), pike conger (hamo), octopus (tako), shrimp (ebi and
        amaebi), clam (mirugai, aoyagi and akagai), fish roe (ikura, masago, kazunoko and tobiko), sea urchin (uni),
        crab (kani), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi.
        Oysters, however, are less common, as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice. Kani kama, or imitation
        crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls.
        Pickled daikon radish (takuan) in shinko maki, pickled vegetables (tsukemono), fermented soybeans (nattō) in
        nattō maki, avocado, cucumber in kappa maki, asparagus, yam, pickled ume (umeboshi), gourd (kanpyō), burdock
        (gobo), and sweet corn (possibly mixed with mayonnaise) are also used in sushi.
        Tofu and eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called tamagoyaki and raw quail eggs ride as a
        gunkan-maki topping) are common.</p>

    <h2>Condiments</h2>
    <p>Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shōyu (soy sauce), and is usually flavored with
        wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the Wasabia japonica plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a
        common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork and other sushi cuts.
        True wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning. The traditional grating
        tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or samegawa oroshi. An imitation wasabi (seiyo-wasabi), made from
        horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end kaiten-zushi restaurants, in bento
        box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled "Japanese
        Horseradish".
        Gari (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion.
        In Japan, green tea (ocha) is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a
        distinctive premium tea known as mecha. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as agari.
        Sushi may be garnished with gobo, grated daikon, thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have
        been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.
        When closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called baran or kiri-zasa
        (切り笹). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an
        attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the Aspidistra elatior (葉蘭 haran) and Sasa
        veitchii (熊笹 kuma-zasa) plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing
        antimicrobial phytoncides when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi. Sushi bento boxes
        are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the
        1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs.
        This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi
        without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a
        lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of
        sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact
        with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.</p>
